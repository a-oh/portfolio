### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My name is Alyssia Oh


I am a data scientist with a passion for translating my scientific mind into actionable insights. I come from a background in biomedical research and drug development where Iâ€™ve been trained on how to think about data, how to design experiments to obtain the desired data, and what the next step should be to strengthen the solution. To facilitate communicating complex ideas, I utilize various data visualization tools to provide an intuitive understanding of the topic to all levels of expertise.

- Data Visualization | Seaborn,  Tableau, matplotlib, ggplot1, ggplot2
- Modeling | Statistical Modeling, Regression Models, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Classification Models, Time Series Analysis, Neural Networks, Image Classification, XGBoost, SVM, Adaboost, Gradient Boosting, Neural Network Classification (NN), Convolutional Neural Nets (CNN), Recurrent Neural Nets (RNN), K-means clustering, PCA analysis, DBSCAN, ARIMA, SARIMAX, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Bagged Decision Trees, ExtraTrees, Natural language processing (NLP)
- Statistics | Statistical Distributions, Bayesian Analysis, p-Values, Hypothesis Testing, Bayes Theorem, Churn/Survival Analysis




**Projects** 

[Linear regression modeling - standardized testing scores in the United States](https://github.com/a-oh/project1-standardizedtesting)- using the linear regression model, I studied which factors correlate highest to the stateâ€™s average SAT score. 
 
Housing price prediction using feature engineering and linear/logistic regression models
- predict housing prices in Ames, IA using historical datasets with the R2 score of 0.942
 
Classification using Natural Language Processing
- built a NLP model that classifies the origin of the news article between two websites. The model performs at 87% accuracy (compared to 50% baseline accuracy)
 
COVID-19 outbreak forecasting
- comparison of various time series models (ARIMA, SARIMAX) and recurrent neural network (LSTM) model to forecast infection rates in California's counties to optimize vaccine distribution plan.
 
Automated job search using web scraping and skill matching
- A model automatically scans new jobs and prioritizes the list by matching the job description to your skillset.
